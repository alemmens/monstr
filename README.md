# me.untethr.nostr-desk


* majorly work-in-progress
  - i.e., don't file bugs yet
  - expect performance weirdness etc
  - enjoy the ugly
* db schema is subject to change rapidly
  - so do this whenever you pull new commits:
    - `$ rm ~/.nostr-desk` 

Pre-requisites:

```
$ brew install clojure/tools/clojure
```

May need to install some java/jdk, say v. 17

How to run:

```
$ make run
```
